    - Prescribe requirements as acquired and conceptualized from requirements stakeholders.

- Informative Document
    - Introduce an idea as to how a problem previously identified could be solved.

## Question 10
> State a few descriptions witht the following categories:

- Event
- Behavior
- Entity
- Function

## Answer

- Event
    - That of the domain which serves the synchronization and communication of cooperating sequences of activities
    
    - An instance in time when an action starts or ends, e.g. the movie-goer has just decided on the movie to watch

- Behavior
    - That of the domain which will, in a software design, best be represented by threads or processes

    - A sequence of several events and actions (possibly seen together with another such sequence of events and actions)

- Function
    - Something that can be done to one or more entities, e.g. opening an account for a person

    - That of the domain which will, in a software design, best be represented by (global or member) functions

- Entity
    - A type of "thing" in the domain that usually has attributes

    - That of the domain which will, in a software design, best be represented by instances of classes

## Question
> State advantages and disadvantings of extreme programming

### Answer
> Advantages:
>   - Scenarios cope with most of common operation. It is easy to identify what type of operation that is required in the userâ€™s stories. 
>   - Customer focus in features by using scenario cards will increase the chance that the software produced will actually meet the needs of the users
> Disadvantages
>   - Using scenarios on a card can bring to a function overlooked or omission which can be a time-consuming process to complete the system.
>   - Two different scenarios can lead to the same function as it will be conflicted each other. Crossing out redundant scenarios can be a cumber some tasks
> Lacks good design as the entire focus is given on the code and good design is important for the software to sell in the market. 
> Does not keep the documentation of the bugs and as a result the same bugs keeps on appearing

## Question 11
> What is Extreme Programming?

### Answer
>  XP is a systematic approach with a set of values, rules and practices for rapidly developing high quality software that provides the highest value for customers.

## Question 12
> State the 5 values of Extreme Programming

## Answer
1. Communication
2. Simplicity
3. Courage
4. Respect
5. Feedback
